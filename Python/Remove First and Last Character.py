#It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

def remove_char(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return '';
    else:
        return s[1:-1];
